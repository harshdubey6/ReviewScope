# ReviewScope User Guide

Welcome to ReviewScope! This guide will help you set up and use ReviewScope for your projects.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

ReviewScope runs as a GitHub App. To install it:

1.  Go to the [ReviewScope GitHub App page](#) (Link to your app).
2.  Click **Install**.
3.  Select the repositories you want ReviewScope to access.
4.  You will be redirected to the ReviewScope Dashboard.

### 2. Configuration

Once installed, you need to configure the AI provider:

1.  Log in to the **ReviewScope Dashboard**.
2.  Navigate to **Settings** for your repository.
3.  Enter your **OpenAI API Key** or **Gemini API Key**.
    -   *Note: Your keys are encrypted and stored securely. We do not use them for anything other than reviewing your code.*
4.  (Optional) Customize the **System Prompt** to define the persona or specific focus areas for the AI (e.g., "Focus on security", "Be concise").

## How to Use

ReviewScope works automatically in the background.

### Automatic Reviews

1.  **Open a Pull Request**: Simply create a new PR in your repository.
2.  **Wait for Review**: ReviewScope will pick up the changes, analyze them, and post comments directly on the PR lines.
3.  **Fix Issues**: Address the comments as you would with a human reviewer.
4.  **Push Updates**: When you push new commits to the same PR, ReviewScope will re-evaluate the changes.

### Manual Triggers & Chat

You can interact with ReviewScope by commenting on the Pull Request. You must mention **@review-scope** for the bot to respond.

Example commands:
```
    @review-scope re-review
```

### Asking Questions

You can also ask specific questions about the code changes:

```
    @review-scope Why is this change necessary?
    @review-scope Can you explain the logic in the auth module?
```

## Understanding the Feedback

ReviewScope provides two types of feedback:

1.  **Static Analysis**: These are deterministic checks (like linting errors).
    -   *Example*: "Console.log left in production code."
2.  **AI Insights**: These are logic and design suggestions.
    -   *Example*: "This function might cause a race condition because..."

## Troubleshooting

-   **No review posted?** Check the Dashboard to see if the job failed or if your API key quota is exceeded.
-   **Too many comments?** Adjust the "Severity Level" in the Repository Settings to only show "High" or "Critical" issues.

If you encounter any issues, please reach out to our support team or open an issue in our [Support Repository](#).
